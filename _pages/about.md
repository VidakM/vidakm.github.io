Welcome to my blog. This is simply a corner on the web where I jot down some thoughts on software design and process with the hopes of feedback and discourse to spark.

You might agree with some content and find other to be misguided, if so, [please reach out](https://www.threads.net/@vidmij). 

I set up this page to help our teams at [Netigate](https://www.netigate.net/) quickly share brief and tailor made guides and agreements with each other.

For the most part you will find content on Event Driven design, Streaming, Data as a product, Warehousing, Data Lakes, LLM orchestration and ML training & deployment.

Some posts are simply writing down the conclusions me and my colleagues have reached, for example what our definitions of certain concepts are, for example events. Others are our practical conclusions of error handling when running event driven services in production. Some are our guideliens for how to develop the software with the flavour of ADRs that worked for us and our process.

The idea is to aggregate this into a software landscape map that we, and perhaps others, can use to navigate the field, onboard each other and aligns teams.
