Some posts are simply writing down the conclusions me and my colleagues have reached, for example what our definitions of certain concepts are, for example events. Others are our practical conclusions of error handling when running event driven services in production. Some are our guideliens for how to develop the software with the flavour of ADRs that worked for us and our process.

The idea is to aggregate this into a software landscape map that we, and perhaps others, can use to navigate the field, onboard each other and aligns teams.
