On this page, we attempt to identify and map relevant technologies, infrastructure and patterns for effective development, and deployment and maintainance of SaaS software. This is an opinionated map and is primarily targeting the Event Driven architecture patterns, though it's notes do mention other patterns and makes cases for and against them.

Currently, not all items in this map have notes or guidelines published. As they get published, they will gain a color coating and become clickable links to the notes. As more notes are published, this map will be expanded, it is lacking at the moment.

You can find all the notes under [Blog](/blog/)

Do note the map is clickable, zoomable and panable.
